# Windows/COFF fat-runtime symbol renamer (whole-variant pass).
#
# Usage: fat_rename.py <prefix> <keepsyms_file> <object_dir>
#
# build.rs copies this into the vectorscan source tree's cmake/ dir for MSVC
# fat-runtime builds; the patched CMakeLists.txt (msvc-support.patch) runs it
# once per micro-arch variant.
#
# The upstream POSIX build_wrapper.sh renames symbols one object at a time,
# relying on a dump of libc's dynamic symbols to know what NOT to rename. That
# doesn't port to the MSVC toolchain (no libc.so to enumerate, no shell), and a
# per-object pass cannot rename a *reference* to a symbol defined in a sibling
# object. Instead we run once per variant after all its objects exist:
#   1. collect every external *defined* symbol across the variant's objects
#      -> these are exactly the symbols the variant owns;
#   2. apply that single rename map ("sym" -> "<prefix>_sym") to *every* object
#      with llvm-objcopy --redefine-syms, which rewrites both the definitions
#      and any (undefined) references to them.
# Symbols the variant does not define -- the CRT (memcpy, ...) and the shared
# allocator hooks in hs_exec_common -- are never in the map, so references to
# them are left intact and still resolve at link time.
